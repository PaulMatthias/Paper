\abstract{
The most fundamental response of an ionized gas to a macroscopic object 
is the formation of the plasma sheath. It is an electron depleted space 
charge region adjacent to the object build-up to screen the object's 
negative charge which arises from the accumulation of electrons from 
the plasma. The plasma sheath is thus the positively charged part of an 
electric double layer whose negatively charged part is inside the wall. 
In the course of the Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR24 
we investigated, from a quantum-mechanical point of view, the elementary 
charge transfer processes responsible for the electric double layer 
and made first steps towards a description of the negative part of the 
layer inside the wall. Below we critically review our work, describe 
possible extensions, and identify key issues which need to be resolved 
to make further progress in the understanding of the electron kinetics 
across plasma-wall interfaces. In particular, we describe the methods 
we applied for the calculation of the electron sticking coefficient 
$S_e$, the ion-wall recombination probability $\alpha_w$, and the 
secondary electron emission coefficient $\gamma_e$ due specifically to 
charge-transferring atom-surface collisions. The concept of an electron
surface layer which we used to merge the sheath potential with the 
slowly varying potential inside the wall seen by surplus electrons
will be also reviewed as well as the approach we proposed to measure
the charge of dust grains optically by Mie scattering. Besides wall 
parameters, the microscopic look at sheath formation provides new vistas 
for the modeling and diagnostics of low-temperature gas discharges. 
A look into the future concludes therefore the presentation. 
%Each subsection contains therefore also a look into the future.
