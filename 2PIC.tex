\subsection{1d3v PIC}
The discharge of the experiment has a cylindrical geometry.
In the centre of the discharge the plasma does not see the edge of the electrodes and therefore no asymmetry effects may take place. 
For the middle of the discharge it is sufficient to do an one-dimensional approach.
The disadvantage of the 1d3v simulation is the neglect of different transport processes in radial direction. 
This leads to a discrepancy between simulation and real experiment.
I adjust my parameters in a way so that I receive comparable results close to one electrode, where the experimental measurements took place.
In this case I cannot compare absolute values but can still see trends in the distribution functions.\\
I can compare these results with a 2d3v simulation.
This will separate the asymmetric influence.
