\chapter{PIC-simulation of a cc-rf discharge}
\label{PIC_discharge}

With the PIC method we simulate the previously described capacitive-coupled radio-frequency discharge.
To prepare our system we start at a pressure of $10\ein{Pa}$ and a peak-to-peak voltage of $800\ein{V}$. 
The moderate pressure ensures us a stable discharge. 
From there on we will reduce the pressure to get to low pressures around $1\ein{Pa}$.
The radio-frequency is set to $13.56\ein{MHz}$.
We set our initial values for the considered electron density $n_e=5\cdot 10^{9}\ein{/cm^{-3}}$ and electron temperature $T_e = 4 \ein{eV}$.
This leads to a Debye-length of $\lambda_{Db} \approx 0.021 \ein{cm}$ and an electron plasma frequency of $\omega_{pe}\approx 3.99 \cdot 10^9 \ein{s^{-1}}$.
Hence follows our spatial resolution 

\begin{align}
    \Delta x &= \lambda_{Db}/2 \approx 0.0105 \ein{cm} \; ,\\
\end{align}

and our time step

\begin{align}
    \Delta t &= 0.2\frac{1}{\omega_{pe}} \approx 5.01 \cdot 10^{-11} \ein{s} \; . \\
\end{align}

The electrode gap of the experiment is $5\ein{cm}$. 
Tests have shown that if we choose our domain that small the resulting bulk is too small.
Hence we do not have a sufficient big plasma to simulate plasma dynamics.
This is due to missing radial transport processes which would be implemented in a two dimensional simulation. 
We set our number of cells $n_{cell}=640$ resulting in a length of $6.72\ein{cm}$.\\

One rf-cycle takes up to $N_{rf}=\frac{1}{\Delta t \cdot 13.56 \ein{MHz}} \approx 1470\ein{steps}$. 
As already discussed it takes up to $10^3$ rf-cycles for the plasma to get to an equilibrated state.
That means we have to calculate at least $1.5 \cdot 10^6$ steps. 
We will always consider a pure Oxygen plasma.


\section{Studies of low pressure discharges}
The resulting potential and density distributions for $p=10\ein{Pa}$ and $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$ are shown in figure (\ref{fig:normal_dist}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/10Pa_400V_dens_light.png}
    \caption{Density distribution of $e^-$, $O_2^+$ and $O^-$ at $10\ein{Pa}$ and $800\ein{V_{pp}}$.}
    \label{fig:normal_dist}
\end{figure}

We see how the densities build a plasma chore with electrons, positive ions and negative ions. 
Further we can see the sheath, where a positive space charge exists.
We are interested in the energy distribution functions of our species, especially the one of $O^-$.
In figure (\ref{fig:normal_energy}) the energy distributions of the positive and negative ions are shown.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../pics/good/10Pa_400V_O2p_energy.png}
    \caption{Logarithmic Energy distribution of positive ions $O_2^+$. Simulation parameters were set to a pressure of $p=10\ein{Pa}$ and a voltage of $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_Om_energy.png}
\caption{Logarithmic energy distribution of negative ions $O^-$. Simulation parameters were set to a pressure of $p=5\ein{Pa}$ and a voltage of $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
    \label{fig:normal_energy}
\end{figure}

The energy distribution of $O_2^+$ (figure \ref{fig:normal_energy}) shows the expected behavior of cold ions in the center of the discharge (bulk) and their acceleration towards the electrodes in the sheath.
The peak is equal to the plasma potential $\Phi_{pl}$.\\
The energy distribution of $O^-$ is similar to an electron energy distribution (\ref{fig:electron_energy}) as they behave just like heavy and slow electrons.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_el_energy.png}
     %\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{compare_el_Om.eps}
     \caption{Logarithmic energy distribution of electrons. Simulation parameters were set to a pressure of $p=5\ein{Pa}$ and a voltage of $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
    \label{fig:electron_energy}
\end{figure}

The difference between both distributions is the high energy tail of negative ions. 
This is due to the production of negative ions in the sheath where they get accelerated by the potential drop towards the bulk.
To have a better understanding of the production rate of $O^-$ we have a look at the dissociative attachment processes (figure \ref{fig:ass_det}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/ass_det.eps}
    \caption{Total numbers of dissociative attachment processes per $10^5$ steps implying the production rate of $O^-$.}
    \label{fig:ass_det}
\end{figure}

We see that most ions are produced in the bulk where they stay relatively cold.
But a few are produced in the sheath. 
These are the ones responsible for the high-energy tail of the energy distribution function.\\
The simulated energy distribution is similar to the one from the experiment.
Both have a high count-rate at low energies descending into a high-energy tail which cuts off at around half of the peak-to-peak voltage(s. figure (\ref{fig:normal_energy})). \\

The density ratio between electrons and negative ions at a pressure of $10\ein{Pa}$ is about $\alpha\approx 0.3$. 
Hence we have to reduce the pressure further to attain a true electronegative plasma.
We will take this measure point as a comparison to our lower pressure results. \\
In figure (\ref{fig:lower_pressure}) the density distribution of $2\ein{Pa}$ is shown.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{../pics/good/2Pa_400V_dens.png}
    \caption{Density distribution at lower pressures (2$\ein{Pa}$). The driver voltage was set to $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
    \label{fig:lower_pressure}
\end{figure}

The number density of negative ions rises when the pressure falls.
We see that at these pressures our plasma is close to an electronegative state.
But looking at the energy distribution functions (fig. \ref{fig:low_pressure_energy}) we do not see a big difference.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{../pics/good/2Pa_400V_Om_energy.png}
    \caption{Logarithmic $O^-$ energy distribution at lower pressure (2$\ein{Pa}$). The driver voltage was set to $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
    \label{fig:low_pressure_energy}
\end{figure}

Our results for low pressure discharges do not give us an explanation for the measured high energetic peak (s. figure \ref{fig:MgO}).


\section{Introduction of second ion emission}
We will introduce \textbf{s}econdary \textbf{i}on \textbf{e}mission (SIE), considering that the experiment delivers a different energy distribution function for different cathode materials. \\
The peak in the negative ion energy distribution is located at the cut off. 
Ions with this energy have to be produced very close or directly at the cathode assuming they only get their energy of the potential.
Another possibility for getting to these high energies is the so called sheath heating.
It describes the acceleration of electrons by the pulsating potential at the sheath (\cite{sheath-heating}).
Similar effects may be seen regarding negative ions.
But this effect would have already shown before (see figure \ref{fig:normal_energy}).
Due to the much higher mass of the negative ions they react much slower.
Hence they do not see the pulsating potential and we can neglect the sheath heating.\\
We will implement an additional ion source at the powered cathode.
Till now the sources of negative ions are not well studied but there exist a lot of theories and assumptions on how negative ions may be formed.
As discussed by Ustaze \cite{surface-inject} negative ions can be produced by electron transfer processes at a wall.
They can be determined by ion beam scattering studies, which is has been amply demonstrated for metal surface, for example in \cite{ion-beam}.
For oxide surfaces there are few studies yet.
Ustaze et al studied the interaction of Oxygen atoms and anions with magnesium oxide (MgO).
The results showed that when impinged with an atom, at the MgO surface an anion was created. 
The idea is that an Oxygen atom $O$ captures an electron from the surface and becomes a negative ion $O^-$. 
This interaction is strong energy dependent with higher capture rates at low energies (<$1\ein{eV}$).
The electron capture can be treated as a non-resonant charge transfer process at the oxygen anion site.
This happens because of the strong charge locality in magnesium oxide. 
In a MgO crystal we consider $Mg^{++}$ and $O^{--}$.
If an atom $O$ gets close to surface it may capture one electron of the anion of MgO.\\
When impinged by anions the MgO surface also leads to an electron loss.
So for a complete description both reactions have to be taken into account.\\
Another approach is given by Stoffels \cite{}. 
He claims that negative ions may be produced through energetic ions $X^+$ colliding with neutrals in the sheath
\begin{align}
    X^+(\mathrm{high E}) + O_2 \rightarrow X^+ + O^+ + O^- \; .
\end{align}
But still the theoretical background for near surface ion production is missing. 
That means that we have no information about when and how many anions may be emitted.\\ 
%Maybe fill in Demkov model phase approach of A^+B -> AB^+

Since we do not follow the neutral particles we may as well inject a negative ion when a positive ion impinges the wall.
We do not claim this to  be correct physically.
But it is a good approximation, because we do not want to compare total numbers with the experiment.
For us it is sufficient to get qualitative results and visual trends.\\
We define the parameter $\eta$ describing the ratio of injected $O^-$ to impinging $O^+_2$.
The anions will be injected with a Maxwell distributed energy. 
We declare that the used method is not exclusive for impinging $O_2^+$ due to the consistent flux $\Gamma_i$ of positive ions towards the anode.
Any other reaction resulting in the injection of negative ions would serve our needs.
Since theoretical studies have not specified the possible reactions yet we stick to our proposed channel of SIE.


\section{Discharge with secondary ion emission}

With the proposed injection model of Oxygen anions we start our simulation over.
In figure ($\ref{fig:sims1}$) we see that the number density of the anions is higher and slightly shifted towards the cathode.
This is due to the additional asymmetric injection process since we just inject them at the cathode.
Here we chose $\eta=0.1$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_dens_sims.png}
    \caption{Simulation with secondary ion emission at the cathode ($\eta=0.03$). The pressure was $5\ein{Pa}$ and we set our voltage to $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$.}
    \label{fig:sims1}
\end{figure}

Since we want to study the behavior of the anions coming from the surface we go on and separate the two species.
We refer to them as anions produced by volumetric processes in the plasma $O^-_p$ and surface anions $O^-_s$. 
In figure (\ref{fig:sims2}) the two anion species number densities are shown.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_dens2_sims.png}
    \caption{Same density profile as in figure (\ref{fig:sims1}) with the number densities of $O^-_p$ and $O^-_s$ separated.}
    \label{fig:sims2}
\end{figure}

We see that the density distribution of $O^-_s$ is of one magnitude higher than $O^-_p$. 
This depends on the chosen injection ratio $\eta$. 
The surface ion density has a peak close to the cathode resulting from the injection of $O^-_s$. 
We notice a small density peak at the sheath edge in front of the cathode which cannot be explained easily. \\

Looking at the energy distributions (s. figure (\ref{fig:sims_distribution})) we see that the anions $O^-_s$ get accelerated by the sheath potential.
After passing the bulk they get reflected in the anode sheath similar to electrons.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_sims_Om_energy_side.png}
    \caption{Logarithmic energy distribution of surface anions $O^-_s$ at $p=5\ein{Pa}$ and $U_{pp}=800\ein{V}$. 
    The injection ratio was $\eta = 0.03$.}
    \label{fig:sims_distribution}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_401V_sims_Om_energy_top.png}
    \caption{Same energy distribution as in figure (\ref{fig:sims_distribution}) shown from the top.}
    %The algebraic sign in front of the energy symbolizes the direction where the ions are heading (negative towards the anode, positive towards the cathode).
    \label{fig:sims_distribution_top}
\end{figure}


Once injected they fly through the bulk and then get reflected by the sheath.
On their way they may collide. 
They can do charge-exchange and elastic collisions with neutral molecules $O_2$ which results in an energy loss for the anion.
After a certain time of flight the anions get cold and stay in the bulk.
There they do not differ from the anions produced by volumetric processes $O^-_p$.
In figure (\ref{fig:coll_sims}) we see the difference between the collision numbers for a normal discharge and a discharge with additional SIE. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../pics/coll_elastic.eps}
    \label{fig:coll_sims}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/coll_elastic_sims.eps}
    \caption{Number of elastic collisions of negative ions $O^-$ with neutral molecules  $O_2$ per $10^5$ steps. 
    On the top side without SIE and on the bottom side with SIE ($\eta=0.03$) where we differ between the two $O^-$ species.}
\end{figure}

As expected for the bulk anions $O_b^-$ there is no difference in the numbers of elastic collisions.
Most elastic collisions happen in he bulk while the sheaths are mostly collisionless.
But for the surface ions $O^-_s$ we can see that they collide a lot in the cathode sheath too which results in an energy loss for the anions. 
This will have an impact on their energy distribution.\\
The negative ion energy distribution depends on when they enter the sheath since the potential is rf modulated.
This and the performed elastic collisions during this phase leads to a peak structure in the ion energy distribution.
%maybe put this into grundlagen
For positive ions the behavior in rf-sheaths is well studied.
Depending on the ratio of the ion transit time $\tau_{ion}$ and the applied power frequency $\tau_{rf}$ the ion energy distribution at the cathode shows saddle like peak structures.
For further information on rf-sheaths we refer to \cite{sheath_analysis}. 
To get an impression of the dynamics in the sheath the phase resolved energy distribution for $O^-_{s}$ is shown in figure (\ref{fig:phase_resolved})). 

%Add phase resolved thing here



We can now see that the density peak at the sheath edge urges from structures in the energy distribution.
To understand this structure we calculate how long an anion stays in the sheath.
Therefore we need the approximate transit time of an anion $\tau_{ion}$ and the rf-cycle time $\tau_{rf}$.
For the transit time $\tau_{ion}$ we assume an average ion energy of $60-80 \ein{eV}$ and a traveled distance of $\approx 1\ein{cm}$.
The ratio
\begin{align}
    \frac{\tau_{ion}}{\tau_{rf}}\approx 4.5
\end{align}
gives us the number of rf-cycles an anion stays in the sheath.
Hence the number of peaks in the ion energy distribution must be similar.
In figure (\ref{fig:sims_distribution}) we can see the high energetic peak and 2-3 lower energy peaks in the bulk region. 
This explains our density peak at the sheath edge.
There may be others too, but they are covered by the cold anions of in the bulk. \\

We can now compare the anion energy distributions with the ones from the experiment.
But in our one dimensional model the anions do not reach the anode.
This is due to the symmetric potential.
In the experiment where the cathode potential is shifted by the self-bias voltage the resulting potential is asymmetric (s. figure (\ref{fig:setup_scheme})). 
That means the anions get enough energy to get to the anode.
To compare our results we take our energy distribution at both sheath edges (s. figure \ref{fig:compare_ied}). \\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../pics/neg_mg.eps}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../pics/good/5Pa_400V_sims_Om_energy_cuts.png}
    \caption{Energy distribution of negative ions $O^-$. Left: Experimental results for $MgO$. Right: Simulation result with SIE. }
    \label{fig:compare_ied}
\end{figure}

We can see that both distributions look similar (s. figure (\ref{fig:compare_ied})).
This confirms that negative ions produced at the surface may lead to the measured high-energetic peak. 
But the energy distribution function of the simulation has low energy peaks (at $< 100\ein{eV}$) too.
These peaks are not observed by the experiment.
This is due to the lack of asymmetry in the simulation.
Because we do not have a self-bias voltage our anion energy is not high enough to get to the anode.
Instead they get reflected and hence build up the described lower energy peaks through the rf and elastic collisions.
In the experiment all high energy anions are detected and thereby out of the discharge.\\

Now we have prepared our system with SIE and gave qualitative description of the discharge.
The simulation results are close to the experimental results.
In the following we want to vary the pressure, the power of the electrode and the injection coefficient $\eta$ to get a more quantitative description. \\
