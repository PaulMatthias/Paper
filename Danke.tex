\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I wish to thank the whole work group of Prof. Ralf Schneider, who put me in touch with this Master Thesis and helped me with good advice and support during this thesis.\\
They always had time to discuss current topics and to help me, no matter if it was about my thesis work or just for fun.
A special thanks goes to Tabea Stegmaier which supported me morally and culinary especially during the last part of this thesis. 
Last but not least, thanks to my family who always backed me up no matter what and everyone else who supported me during this thesis.
